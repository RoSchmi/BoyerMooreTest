I found this adaption for C#

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37500629/find-byte-sequence-within-a-byte-array

and made an adaption that it can be used with NETMF and TinyCLR
I didn't make tests if this algorithm is a good choice to use it with NETMF and TinyCLR.
I just used it and it worked.

An algorithm to find the first occurrence of a byte sequence in a byte array is shown here:
